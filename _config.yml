  I am Carlos Josué Díaz and these are my programed code projects I have created.
  This is one of my many skills I have learned in the University of Central Florida 1st year in the Master Degree program.
  <br><br>
  I have used my artistic creativity on each of these p5.js and put a spin on some of them that I have learned in Programming in Digital Media class.
  I also have skills in 3D modeling, Adobe Creative, and Microsoft 365.
