## Ever More

For this project it had to be an external one where I did it for another class, which was Media Aesthetics. It was for a project where we had to create our own copyright free visual novel. It was either to make a game or something interactive where the player can choose what to do but needed at least one choice to make to lead to at least two different paths. It required to have images, description of text, 2D art, and an article statement. The story I chose to do that was copyright free was the classic poem “The Raven” and the spin I put on it was where the man moved to a farm where he can put up a scarecrow to scare away the raven. But things take a dark turn, so he is left with a decision either to keep the scarecrow or take it down. Find out what happens next in the story, and you will know why I named this novel “Ever More.”
