## Mimir's Riddle

For the first project I made had to be an adventurous game and I thought what can be more of an adventurous game than riddles. So, I made a small game where the player must go through doors to answer the riddle which is “There are three doors before you. One contains a pit of spikes, another a dragon, and the last one a pair of lions that have not been fed in weeks. Which door do you open?” I heard this when I was playing the game “God of War Ragnarök” from the character named Mimir. Want to know the answer play the game.
