## Symbio-so

This project was a personal one that I did just to see if I could do it. It all started when I was still learning how the codes worked in p5.js that I started doing new techniques. I recently saw the movie “Venom: The Last Dance” and I was inspired by it to create my own experience of it. Spoiler alert, this last movie had various kinds of animals having symbiotes and I always wanted a game where you do not just play a symbiote on a human host but also on different animals. With a few extra tweaks I was able to finish making this code that gave that experience where the symbiote can go to different animals and be just like them. With a bonus of using animals, I obtained from adobe image stock and editing them in photoshop to make it more realistic and the ability of using my other skills to add on to this project.
